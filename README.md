:octocat: Hi! I teach high school computer programming in Arlington, Virginia. I teach a variety of classes ranging from introductory computer programming to AP Computer Science.

This GitHub account keeps track of all of my school-related projects and code that I want to share with my students.

[Check out my personal GitHub account here](https://github.com/cmj7gh)
[I like to write about my projects on my blog here](https://chrismjon.es/)

Here are a few repos that I'm especially proud of:
- 🦆 [My classroom management and hallpass system](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/Duck)
- 🐈 [A sample pygame about herding cats](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/Herding-Cats)
- 📑 [My attempt to generate lecture slides using Jinja, Pandoc, and Reveal](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/Slides)

My goal is to be an excellent teacher, and I welcome any collaboration, feedback, or support on that journey ❤️
