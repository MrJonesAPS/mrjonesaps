:octocat: Hi! I teach computer programming at a high school in Arlington, Virginia. I teach a variety of classes at all levels of experience from intro to Dual Enrollment including IT, web design, and computer science.

This GitHub account keeps track of all of my school-related projects and code that I want to share with my students.

Here are a few repos that I'm especially proud of:
- 🦆 [My classroom management and hallpass system](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/Duck) (read the [blog post here](https://chrismjon.es/portfolio/project.html?id=hallpass))
- 🧑‍🎓 [A course advising website for Arlington Computer Science students](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/APS-CS-Courses) ([online here](https://apscs.org/))
- 🐈 [A sample pygame about herding cats](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/Herding-Cats)
- 📑 [My attempt to generate lecture slides using Jinja, Pandoc, and Reveal](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/Slides)
- 🏅 [Python code with complicated bugs to help students practice using a debugger](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/TurboTag)
- ✔ A large repo of CS tests and quizzes written in LaTeX (Private, but I'm happy to share with other teachers. Message me if you're interested!)

My goal is to be an excellent teacher, and I welcome any collaboration, feedback, or support on that journey ❤️
